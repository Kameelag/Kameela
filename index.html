      <p> Hello, I am Kameela. Welcome to Upcycle. I am a 16 year old rising junior.
          I enjoy watching/anaylizing film and documentaries. I hope to one day
          make short films with a strong sense of aesthetic. I feel that art can
          be shown through many aspects of life. I also enjoy hiking and the beaut of
          nature. One of my hobbies is thrifting becasue I enjoy acquiring nice
          clothes for cheap.

      <h3> Upcycling </h3>

      <p>  Upcycling is the recycling and reconstruction of clothes from second hand/thrift stores.
      Upcycling shows it is possible to have stylish clothes without spending lots of money.
      Before learning to upcycle, I often felt like clothes that I wanted to buy were overpriced or unaffordable.
      With this dilemma, I realized upcycling is a realistic way to make affordable and attractive clothes.
      Upcycling is especially cost-efficient for people who do not have the option to buy more expensive clothes.
      Upcycling promotes the global context of personal and cultural expression.
      It shows that self expression through clothes is not limited by the amount of money you have.
      It allows you to explore whatever ideas come to mind (realistically of course).
      You can add original ideas and personal taste to the clothes unlike when buying
      clothes directly from a store where most people keep the clothes the same.
      Overall, upcycling saves money and inspires creativity and originality.
      </p>
